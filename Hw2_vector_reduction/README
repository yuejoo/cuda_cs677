ta Parallel Reduction



1) Extract the contents of the zip file into your SDK projects

directory.



2)  Edit the source files vector_reduction.cu and vector_reduction_kernel.cu

    to complete the functionality of the parallel addition reduction on the

    device.  The size of the array is guaranteed to be equal to 512 elements

    for this assignment.



3)  There are two modes of operation for the application.



    No arguments:  The application will create a randomly initialized array to

    process.  After the device kernel is invoked, it will compute

    the correct solution value using the CPU, and compare that solution with

    the device-computed solution.  If it matches (within a certain tolerance),

    if will print out "Test PASSED" to the screen before exiting.



    One argument:  The application will initialize the input array with

    the values found in the file provided as an argument.



    In either case, the program will print out the final result of the CPU and

    GPU computations, and whether or not the comparison passed.



4)  "#define num_elements" in vector_reduction_kernel.cu defines the number of

    elements which will be computed.
